# Building an RNN from Scratch and Application for Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging

We're implementing a vanilla RNN completely from scratch, armed with nothing but:
- NumPy
- Basic calculus

Our mission? Teaching a neural network to figure out parts of speech (POS)

The Game Plan
- Build an RNN cell
- Stack them together
- Make it learn through backpropagation
- Apply it to POS tagging
